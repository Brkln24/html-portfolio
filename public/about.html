  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr/>
  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Brooklyn- a Frontend Developer & UI Enthusiast</p>
<p>I have a strong passion for building clean, responsive, and intuitive user interfaces. My journey into development started with a simple idea: creating software that makes managing basketball teams easier. Since then, I’ve been exploring modern frontend technologies to craft seamless digital experiences.</p>

<h2>What Do I Do?</h2>
<p>I specialize in React, Tailwind CSS, and Material Tailwind, focusing on creating engaging and efficient UIs. My projects emphasize functionality and usability, ensuring that every interface is both visually appealing and easy to navigate.<p>

<h2>Projects & Experience:</h2>
<p>I’ve worked on projects like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basketball Team Manager App – A tool for managing lineups, tracking player performance, and organizing training sessions.</li>
  <li>Birthday Party Invitations – A website that allows people to easily craft and send out birthday invitations.</li>
  <li>Movie Critic Website – A simple website where I share my thoughts on various Movies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project showcases my ability to blend design with functionality, always prioritizing user experience.</p>

<h2>Always Learning</h2>
<p>I’m constantly expanding my skill set, currently exploring Django, SQLite, and backend integration to enhance my full-stack development capabilities. My goal is to build more advanced applications with seamless UI/UX.</p>
